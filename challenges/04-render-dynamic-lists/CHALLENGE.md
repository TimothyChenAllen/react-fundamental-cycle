# Challenge 04: Render Dynamic Lists

## Phase 1: Static UI Foundations

### Objective
Move hardcoded items to an array and render them dynamically using `.map()` with proper keys.

### Requirements
- Convert hardcoded items to a data array
- Use `.map()` to render list items dynamically
- Add unique `key` props for each list item
- Maintain the same visual appearance
- Ensure proper React rendering optimization

### Expected Outcome
- Dynamic list rendering from data array
- Proper key usage for React optimization
- Same visual appearance as previous challenges
- Scalable approach for handling larger datasets

### Learning Goals
- Dynamic rendering with `.map()`
- React key prop importance
- Data-driven components
- Performance considerations

### Next Steps
This dynamic rendering approach will be enhanced with filtering, sorting, and other data manipulation features.
