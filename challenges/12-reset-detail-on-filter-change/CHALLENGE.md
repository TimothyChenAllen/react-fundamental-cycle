- Handle edge cases properly

### Expected Outcome
- Automatic reset of selection when filter changes
- Consistent UI state during filtering
- Smooth user experience
- Proper handling of filter edge cases

### Learning Goals
- useEffect for side effects
- State synchronization patterns
- User experience considerations
- React lifecycle management

### Next Steps
This state synchronization pattern will be enhanced with more sophisticated state management approaches.
