# Challenge 15: useReducer for Complex Updates

## Phase 3: Scaling State

### Objective
Manage list and detail transitions with a reducer to handle complex state updates more predictably.

### Requirements
- Implement useReducer for complex state management
- Create action types for different state transitions
- Handle list filtering, selection, and updates through reducer
- Maintain predictable state updates
- Ensure proper action dispatching patterns

### Expected Outcome
- Predictable state management with reducer
- Clear action types and payloads
- Complex state transitions handled properly
- Improved state debugging and testing

### Learning Goals
- useReducer hook
- Action and reducer patterns
- Complex state management
- Predictable state updates

### Next Steps
This reducer pattern will be combined with Context for a complete state management solution.
