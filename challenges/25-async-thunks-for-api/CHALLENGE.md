# Challenge 25: Async Thunks for API

## Phase 5: Advanced State Management

### Objective
Move fetch and POST logic into async thunks to handle API calls within Redux architecture.

### Requirements
- Create async thunks for API calls
- Handle loading, success, and error states
- Integrate thunks with Redux store
- Manage API state in Redux
- Implement proper error handling

### Expected Outcome
- Centralized API logic in Redux
- Proper loading and error state management
- Clean separation of concerns
- Scalable API integration

### Learning Goals
- Async thunk patterns
- Redux API integration
- State management for async operations
- Error handling in Redux

### Next Steps
This async thunk approach will be enhanced with RTK Query for advanced caching and invalidation.
