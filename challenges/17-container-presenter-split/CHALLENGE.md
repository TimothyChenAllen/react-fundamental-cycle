# Challenge 17: Containerâ€“Presenter Split

## Phase 3: Scaling State

### Objective
Refactor the application to separate container components (managing state/effects) from presenter components (pure UI).

### Requirements
- Split components into containers and presenters
- Containers handle state, effects, and business logic
- Presenters are pure components focused on UI
- Maintain clean separation of concerns
- Ensure proper data flow between containers and presenters

### Expected Outcome
- Clear separation between logic and presentation
- Reusable presenter components
- Testable container components
- Improved component architecture

### Learning Goals
- Container-presenter pattern
- Separation of concerns
- Component architecture
- Testability improvements

### Next Steps
This architectural foundation will be enhanced with remote data fetching and API integration.
