# Challenge 02: Reusable ListItem Component

## Phase 1: Static UI Foundations

### Objective
Extract a reusable `ListItem` presenter component and use props for title and description.

### Requirements
- Extract `ListItem` as a separate presenter component
- Use props to pass title and description data
- Keep the component pure and focused on presentation
- Maintain the same visual appearance as Challenge 01
- Make the component reusable across different item types

### Expected Outcome
- A reusable `ListItem` component that accepts props
- Clean separation between data and presentation
- Component can be easily reused with different data
- Maintains the master-detail layout from Challenge 01

### Learning Goals
- Component composition
- Props and prop types
- Presenter component pattern
- Reusability principles

### Next Steps
This reusable component will be enhanced in future challenges to add interactivity and state management.
