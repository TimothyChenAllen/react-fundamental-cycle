# Challenge 07: Selectable List Items

## Phase 2: Adding Interactivity (Local State)

### Objective
Add click handlers to select items and store the `activeId` in component state.

### Requirements
- Add click handlers to list items
- Store selected item ID in state using `useState`
- Update detail view when an item is selected
- Provide visual feedback for selected items
- Handle the initial state (no selection)

### Expected Outcome
- Clickable list items that update the detail view
- Visual indication of selected item
- State-driven detail view updates
- Smooth user interaction flow

### Learning Goals
- Event handling in React
- useState hook for local state
- Interactive UI patterns
- State-driven rendering

### Next Steps
This interactive foundation will be enhanced with more complex state management and additional user interactions.
