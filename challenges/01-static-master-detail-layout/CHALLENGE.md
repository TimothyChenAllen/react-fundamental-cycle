# Challenge 01: Static Masterâ€“Detail Layout

## Phase 1: Static UI Foundations

### Objective
Create a single component that renders a hardcoded list and a default detail view. No state management yet - just static UI.

### Requirements
- Create a single React component
- Display a hardcoded list of items (e.g., books, movies, products)
- Show a default detail view for one of the items
- No interactivity or state management required
- Focus on establishing the basic layout structure

### Expected Outcome
A simple master-detail interface where:
- Left side shows a static list of items
- Right side shows details for a pre-selected item
- Layout is responsive and visually separated

### Learning Goals
- Understanding master-detail pattern
- Basic component structure
- Static data rendering
- Layout fundamentals

### Next Steps
This foundation will be built upon in subsequent challenges to add interactivity, state management, and more complex features.
