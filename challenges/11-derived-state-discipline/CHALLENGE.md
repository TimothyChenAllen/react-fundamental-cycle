# Challenge 11: Derived State Discipline

## Phase 2: Adding Interactivity (Local State)

### Objective
Compute derived values instead of storing them in state to follow React best practices.

### Requirements
- Compute filtered items from search text and original list
- Calculate derived values using useMemo or direct computation
- Avoid storing computed values in state
- Optimize performance with proper memoization
- Demonstrate derived state patterns

### Expected Outcome
- Efficient derived state computation
- No redundant state storage
- Optimized performance with memoization
- Clean separation of source and derived data

### Learning Goals
- Derived state patterns
- useMemo hook usage
- Performance optimization
- React state management best practices

### Next Steps
This derived state approach will be essential for more complex state management and performance optimization.
