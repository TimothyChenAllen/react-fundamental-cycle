# Challenge 22: Route-Based Selection

## Phase 5: Advanced State Management

### Objective
Introduce routing with `/items` and `/items/[id]` routes and synchronize selection with URL state.

### Requirements
- Implement routing with Next.js or React Router
- Create routes for list (`/items`) and detail (`/items/[id]`)
- Synchronize selected item with URL parameters
- Handle direct URL navigation
- Maintain proper routing patterns

### Expected Outcome
- URL-based navigation
- Synchronized selection state with URL
- Direct link sharing capability
- Proper routing architecture

### Learning Goals
- React routing patterns
- URL state synchronization
- Navigation management
- Deep linking support

### Next Steps
This routing foundation will be enhanced with Redux Toolkit for more sophisticated state management.
