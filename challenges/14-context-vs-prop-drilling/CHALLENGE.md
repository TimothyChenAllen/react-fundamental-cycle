# Challenge 14: Context vs Prop Drilling

## Phase 3: Scaling State

### Objective
Replace deep prop passing with React Context to avoid prop drilling and improve component architecture.

### Requirements
- Create a Context for shared state
- Replace prop drilling with Context consumption
- Provide state and actions through Context
- Maintain proper Context provider patterns
- Ensure components can access state without prop drilling

### Expected Outcome
- Eliminated prop drilling
- Clean component interfaces
- Centralized state through Context
- Improved component reusability

### Learning Goals
- React Context API
- Context provider patterns
- Avoiding prop drilling
- Global state management

### Next Steps
This Context approach will be enhanced with useReducer for more complex state management patterns.
