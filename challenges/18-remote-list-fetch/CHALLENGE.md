# Challenge 18: Remote List Fetch

## Phase 4: Remote Data & Effects

### Objective
Replace local data with `GET /api/items` and add proper loading, error, and empty states.

### Requirements
- Fetch data from `/api/items` endpoint
- Handle loading states during fetch
- Display error states for failed requests
- Show empty states when no data is available
- Use useEffect for data fetching

### Expected Outcome
- Remote data fetching from API
- Proper loading, error, and empty states
- Robust error handling
- Better user experience with state feedback

### Learning Goals
- Data fetching with useEffect
- Loading and error state management
- API integration patterns
- User experience considerations

### Next Steps
This remote data approach will be enhanced with individual item fetching and more sophisticated data management.
