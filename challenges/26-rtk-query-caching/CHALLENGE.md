# Challenge 26: RTK Query Caching

## Phase 5: Advanced State Management

### Objective
Replace async thunks with RTK Query for automatic caching, invalidation, and optimized data fetching.

### Requirements
- Set up RTK Query API slice
- Define endpoints for list and detail fetching
- Implement automatic caching and invalidation
- Handle optimistic updates with RTK Query
- Leverage RTK Query's built-in features

### Expected Outcome
- Automatic data caching
- Optimized API calls
- Built-in loading and error states
- Improved performance and user experience

### Learning Goals
- RTK Query setup and configuration
- Caching and invalidation patterns
- Optimistic updates with RTK Query
- Advanced Redux patterns

### Next Steps
This RTK Query foundation will be enhanced with multi-step forms and comprehensive testing.
