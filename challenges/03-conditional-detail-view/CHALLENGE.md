# Challenge 03: Conditional Detail View

## Phase 1: Static UI Foundations

### Objective
Show detail view only when an item is selected; otherwise display a placeholder message.

### Requirements
- Add conditional rendering for the detail view
- Show a placeholder when no item is selected
- Display full detail information when an item is selected
- Maintain the list view on the left side
- Use state to track which item is selected

### Expected Outcome
- Detail view conditionally renders based on selection
- Placeholder message when nothing is selected
- Full detail information when an item is selected
- Clear visual feedback for the selected state

### Learning Goals
- Conditional rendering in React
- State management basics
- User experience considerations
- Component state patterns

### Next Steps
This conditional rendering pattern will be enhanced with more sophisticated state management in upcoming challenges.
