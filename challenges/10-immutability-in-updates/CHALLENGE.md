# Challenge 10: Immutability in Updates

## Phase 2: Adding Interactivity (Local State)

### Objective
Ensure all array and object updates are immutable to follow React best practices.

### Requirements
- Use immutable update patterns for all state changes
- Avoid direct mutation of arrays and objects
- Use spread operator and other immutable techniques
- Update list items, form data, and selection state immutably
- Demonstrate proper React state update patterns

### Expected Outcome
- All state updates follow immutable patterns
- No direct mutations of state objects
- Proper React re-rendering behavior
- Clean and predictable state management

### Learning Goals
- Immutability in React
- Spread operator usage
- Array and object update patterns
- React state update best practices

### Next Steps
This immutable foundation will be crucial for more complex state management patterns and performance optimization.
