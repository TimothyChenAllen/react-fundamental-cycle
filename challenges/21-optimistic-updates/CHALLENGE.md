# Challenge 21: Optimistic Updates

## Phase 4: Remote Data & Effects

### Objective
Implement optimistic updates by immediately adding items to the UI, then reconciling with server response.

### Requirements
- Immediately update UI when adding items
- Send API request in background
- Reconcile optimistic update with server response
- Handle rollback on API failures
- Maintain data consistency

### Expected Outcome
- Instant UI feedback for user actions
- Robust error handling with rollbacks
- Improved perceived performance
- Better user experience

### Learning Goals
- Optimistic update patterns
- Error handling with rollbacks
- Performance optimization
- User experience improvements

### Next Steps
This optimistic approach will be enhanced with routing and more sophisticated state management.
