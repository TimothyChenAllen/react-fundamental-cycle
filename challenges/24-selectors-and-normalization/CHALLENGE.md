# Challenge 24: Selectors & Normalization

## Phase 5: Advanced State Management

### Objective
Normalize items by ID and create memoized selectors for efficient data access and performance.

### Requirements
- Normalize data structure by ID
- Create memoized selectors with reselect
- Implement efficient data access patterns
- Optimize performance with proper selectors
- Handle normalized data updates

### Expected Outcome
- Normalized data structure
- Efficient data access with selectors
- Performance optimizations
- Scalable data management

### Learning Goals
- Data normalization patterns
- Selector creation and memoization
- Performance optimization
- Redux data management

### Next Steps
This normalized approach will be enhanced with async thunks for API integration.
