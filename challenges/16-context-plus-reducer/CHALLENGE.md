- Context provides state and actions
- Reducer handles all state transitions
- Clean and scalable architecture

### Learning Goals
- Combining Context and useReducer
- Global state management patterns
- Scalable React architecture
- State management best practices

### Next Steps
This foundation will be enhanced with container-presenter separation for better component architecture.
