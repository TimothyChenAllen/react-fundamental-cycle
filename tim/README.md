# Challenge 01: Static Master-Detail Solution

This directory contains my solutions for the challenges in the `react-fundamental-cycle` series.

## ðŸš€ How to Run This Solution

To ensure this solution runs independently without conflicting with the main application, a dedicated launch script has been created.

1.  **Navigate to the root directory** of the `react-fundamental-cycle` project in your terminal.
2.  **Run the following command**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev:tim
    ```
3.  **Open your browser** and go to [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001).

This will start a development server specifically for this solution on port `3001`.
